To answer questions like OOPS, DSA, etc., you must have a solid grasp of computer science Concepts There are a sufficient number of Data Structures Problems. To prepare you for the test, let’s first go through the fundamental guidelines

Data Structures:A data structure is a storage that is used to store and organize data. It is used for processing, retrieving, and storing data. There are different basic and advanced types of data structures used in almost every program or software system that has been developed.

Algorithms:Algorithm refers to a sequence of finite steps to solve a particular problem.The word Algorithm means ” A set of rules to be followed in calculations or other problem-solving operations ” Or ” A procedure for solving a mathematical problem in a finite number of steps that are frequently by recursive operations “.

OOPS Concepts: As the name suggests, Object-Oriented Programming or OOPs refers to languages that use objects in programming, they use objects as a primary source to implement what is to happen in the code.Object-oriented programming aims to implement real-world entities like inheritance, hiding, polymorphism etc.'''

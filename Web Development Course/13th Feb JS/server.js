// - number: 2,3,4,5, 4.5, 54.75489
// - string: "Shivam" or 'Shivam'
// - Boolean: true, false 
// - null: This is empty data type and has no value assigned to it
// - undefined: it is given when a variable is unintialized

// Non - Primitive Data Type

// - Array: [] - Same as list in python (thus can store data of various data types in general)
// Example: 
let names = ["Shivam", "Jha", "Hitesh", "Ram"]
console.log(names)

// (Also it is important to note that js is very forgiving thus if you forget to put ";" there would be no such error)

// - Object: {} - This is very important but would be discussed later

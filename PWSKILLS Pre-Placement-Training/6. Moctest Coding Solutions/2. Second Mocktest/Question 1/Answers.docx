        1. Static Position:
        The static position is the default position of an element. Elements with static position are positioned according to the
        normal flow of the document. No positioning properties (`top`, `bottom`, `left`, `right`) have any effect on static
        elements. Here's an example:
        
        ```html
        <style>
            .box {
                position: static;
            }
        </style>
        
        <div class="box">Static Position</div>
        ```
        
        2. Fixed Position:
        Elements with fixed position are positioned relative to the viewport and do not move when the page is scrolled. Fixed
        elements are fixed in their position even if the page is scrolled. Here's an example:
        
        ```html
        <style>
            .box {
                position: fixed;
                top: 20px;
                left: 20px;
            }
        </style>
        
        <div class="box">Fixed Position</div>
        ```
        
        3. Sticky Position:
        Sticky positioning is a mix between static and fixed positioning. A sticky element is positioned relative to its nearest
        scrolling ancestor or the viewport, depending on whether the element is within a scrolling container. It remains in the
        normal flow until the scroll position crosses a specified threshold. Here's an example:
        
        ```html
        <style>
            .box {
                position: sticky;
                top: 50px;
            }
        </style>
        
        <div class="scroll-container">
            <div class="box">Sticky Position</div>
            <!-- Content that triggers scrolling -->
        </div>
        ```
        
        4. Relative Position:
        Elements with relative position are positioned relative to their normal position. It allows you to adjust the position
        of an element relative to its original position. Here's an example:
        
        ```html
        <style>
            .box {
                position: relative;
                top: 20px;
                left: 20px;
            }
        </style>
        
        <div class="box">Relative Position</div>
        ```
        
        5. Absolute Position:
        Elements with absolute position are positioned relative to their closest positioned ancestor (i.e., an ancestor with a
        position other than static) or the containing block if no positioned ancestor exists. They are taken out of the normal
        flow of the document. Here's an example:
        
        ```html
        <style>
            .parent {
                position: relative;
                width: 200px;
                height: 200px;
            }
        
            .box {
                position: absolute;
                top: 50px;
                left: 50px;
            }
        </style>
        
        <div class="parent">
            <div class="box">Absolute Position</div>
        </div>
        ```

// In question number 6 there is no definition for isBadVersion defined and there for no answer could be generated at this place yes although on leetcode I can give you the answer and the link to it is given here.

/*
The solution is  this and you may copy it and get the answer but in local IDE it won't give the correct answer.

// The API isBadVersion is defined for you.
// bool isBadVersion(int version);

class Solution {
public:
    int firstBadVersion(int n)
{
    int left = 1;
    int right = n;

    while (left < right)
    {
        int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;

        if (isBadVersion(mid))
        {
            // If the mid version is bad, we know the first bad version must be on or before mid
            right = mid;
        }
        else
        {
            // If the mid version is good, we know the first bad version must be after mid
            left = mid + 1;
        }
    }

    // At this point, left and right will point to the first bad version
    return left;
}
};
